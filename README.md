# microfrontend

A micro starter to basically to save me time when I want to mess around with an idea.

## Get started:

```bash
npm install -g degit
degit rtorr/microfrontend my-new-project
cd my-new-project
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:4200
```

## Hidden files:

When using vscode you will notice some files are hidden. This is to keep a few things out of the way while I hack an idea.
